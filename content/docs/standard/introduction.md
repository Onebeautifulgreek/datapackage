A Data Package is a simple container format used to describe and package a collection of data (a dataset).

A Data Package can contain any kind of data. At the same time, Data Packages can be specialized and enriched for specific types of data so there are, for example, Tabular Data Packages for tabular data, Geo Data Packages for geo data etc.

At the core of the **Data Package standard** is a set of specifications for describing data including **Table Schema** and **Table Dialect** (for tables), **Data Resource** (for files), and **Data Package** (for datasets).

## Design Philosophy

### Simplicity

Seek zen-like simplicity in which there is nothing to add and nothing to take away.

### Extensibility

Design for extensibility and customisation. This makes hard things possible and permits future evolution -- nothing we build will be perfect.

### Human-editable and machine-usable

Specs should preserve human readability and editability whilst making machine-use easy.

### Reuse

Reuse and build on existing standards and formats.

### Cross technology

Support a broad range of languages, technologies and infrastructures -- avoid being tied to any one specific system.
