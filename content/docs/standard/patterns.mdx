Patterns are various approaches for solving common problems, in ways that are not (yet) specified as a formal Data Package specification. If we see increased adoption, or wide support, for any pattern, it is a prime candidate for formalising as part of a specification. Here is the list of currently existent patterns:

## Data Package

<CardGrid>

<LinkCard
  title="Data Catalog"
  description="Create a centralized repository for data discovery, cataloging, and organization."
  href="/patterns/data-catalog"
/>

<LinkCard
  title="Data Dependencies"
  description="Manage data dependencies effectively, ensuring that all required resources are accessible and up-to-date."
  href="/patterns/data-dependencies"
/>

<LinkCard
  title="Data Package Version"
  description="Track and manage different versions of data packages to support reproducibility and historical analysis."
  href="/patterns/data-package-version"
/>

<LinkCard
  title="Language Support"
  description="Enhance data packages with support for multiple languages to accommodate diverse user communities."
  href="/patterns/language-support"
/>

<LinkCard
  title="Private Properties"
  description="Secure sensitive data by designating properties as private within your data package."
  href="/patterns/private-properties"
/>

<LinkCard
  title="Translation Support"
  description="Enable data translation and localization for global accessibility and understanding."
  href="/patterns/translation-support"
/>
</CardGrid>

## Data Resource

<LinkCard

/>

<LinkCard
  title="Nested Resources"

</CardGrid>

## Table Schema

<CardGrid>
<LinkCard
  title="External Foreign Keys"
  description="Establish relationships between data resources using external foreign keys to enhance data connectivity."
  href="/patterns/external-foreign-keys"
/>

<LinkCard
  title="Metadata in Table Schema"
  description="Enrich table schemas with detailed metadata to provide context and meaning to your data."
  href="/patterns/metadata-in-table-schema"
/>

<LinkCard
  title="Missing Values per Field"
  description="Define how missing or null values are handled on a per-field basis for precise data management."
  href="/patterns/missing-values-per-field"
/>

<LinkCard
    title="Unique Constraints"
    description="Enforce unique constraints on specific data fields to maintain data integrity and uniqueness."
