Patterns are various approaches for solving common problems, in ways that are not (yet) specified as a formal Data Package specification. If we see increased adoption, or wide support, for any pattern, it is a prime candidate for formalising as part of a specification. Here is the list of currently existent patterns:

## Getting Started

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="How to start using Data Package"
    description="Data Package sounds great but you don't know where to start?"
    href="/guides/using-data-package"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Extending the Standard

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="How to extend Data Package"
    description="This guide will walk you through an example of creating a Data Package extension."
    href="/guides/extending-data-package"
  />
</CardGrid>
